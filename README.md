## Completed tasks
### 1. Sorts
Write a program that implements `BubbleSort`, `InsertionSort`, `SelectionSort` iteratively and `MergeSort` recursively.
### 2. Permutator
Write a recursive algorithm that finds all permutations of numbers the specified sequence.
### 3. Prime palindrome
Write a program that returns the largest palindrome, which is a composition of two simple five-digit numbers, and returns the factors themselves. A simple number is a natural number that is divided entirely only by 1 and by itself (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...). A palindrome is a string, which is read equally in both directions (for example ABBA). Optimize program code so that calculations take less time.
### 4. Linked list
Write a program that allows you to create a singly-linked list, display it, add new element in the beginning, in the end, by index, delete element from the end, by index. Also check this list for presence of cycle and check ascending order of elements.
